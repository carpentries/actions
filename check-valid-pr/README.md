# Check Valid PR action

This action checks that a pull request number:

- is not closed
- does not contain modification to workflow files
- is identical to a SHA hash of the PR that launched the workflow

# Usage

Inputs available:

- `pr` : **Required** The pull request number
- `repo` : **Required** The value of the repository. Defaults to `github.repository`
- `token` : **Required** The default token for authorization. Defaults to `github.token`
- `sha` : The expected SHA hash for the head commit of the pull request. This is optional, but is very useful in runs that are triggered from pull request workflow runs.
- `invalid` : A commit that should no longer exist on the production branch in the repository. 
An example is a commit that has been removed by [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/).
This will compare this hash against the incoming pull request branch.
If a 404 is returned or the status is "diverged", then the invalid hash does not exist in the branch and the PR is valid.
If the invalid hash is found within the branch (status "before" or "after"), then the process fails. 
- `fail_on_error` : check all sources of potential failure and report a single boolean for use in downstream events, default `false`.
If `true` this action will fail when it encounters an invalid pull request, which is useful in a `pull_request_target` context.

## Outputs

- `VALID` : `true` if the Pull Request is valid (e.g. it exists and does not modify any actions files)
- `payload` : The pull request payload if it's not a spoof or closed pull request.
- `MSG` : A markdown-formatted message that can be used as a pull request comment to inform the maintainers about the validity of the pull request to aid them in deciding if they should run additional workflows. 

## Example

Note: This runs on `pull_request_target`, so it can not be modified by the pull request author.
If you want to run code from the pull request, be sure to only run it after this finishes. 

```yaml
name: "internally receive PR"

on:
  pull_request_target:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  test-pr:
    name: "Test pull request validity"
    if: ${{ github.event.action != 'closed' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      is_valid: ${{ steps.check-pr.outputs.VALID }}
      MSG: ${{ steps.check-pr.outputs.MSG }}
    steps:
      - name: "Check PR"
        id: check-pr
        uses: carpentries/actions/check-valid-pr@add-invalid-hash
        with:
          pr: 2
          invalid: e83e2c9bdeb259fcb7b12ae21da8f6eac8ff34a4
      - name: "Comment on PR"
        id: comment-diff
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: carpentries/actions/comment-diff@main
        with:
          pr: ${{ github.event.number }} 
          body: ${{ steps.check-pr.outputs.MSG }}
```
