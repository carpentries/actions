# Download and update sandpaper workflow files from an upstream repository
#
# usage:
#   bash update-workflows.sh [UPSTREAM] [SOURCE] [CLEAN]
#
# args:
#   UPSTREAM - a version number from which to fetch the workflows. By default,
#     this is fetched from https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/api/packages/sandpaper
#   SOURCE - a CRAN-like repository from which to fetch a tarball of sandpaper
#     By default this is fetched from https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/
#   CLEAN files to clean as a pattern. Example: *.yaml will clean all the yaml
#     files, but will leave the yml files alone.
#
# example: Reset the workflow versions to that of 0.0.0.9041 from the drat
#   archives
#
# bash update-workflows.sh 0.0.0.9041 https://carpentries.github.io/drat/ *.yaml
